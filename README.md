### Setup

* Clone/Download
* `npm i`
* `node server.js` and `webpack -w`

### Concerns

* How to filter items
* Firebase security?
* Latest runs table alongside top runs?

### Shit to do (most important at the top)

* Make course longer (absolute minimum 30 secs for run)
* use instructor pictures as hazards to dodge
* convert platforms to crates
* Add instructor quotes
* Style leaderboard page properly
* Rubot's Adventure title + styling
* Add ruby collection to the endgame fail screen
